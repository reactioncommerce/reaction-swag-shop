This repository contains the reaction-swag-shop plugin that's intended as a learning resource for everybody
who's facing the task of customizing Reaction for her/his own shop implementation. Additionally, this repository drives
our real swag shop that's offering merchandising products at [swag.getreaction.io](swag.getreaction.io).


### Getting started
If you would like to use this shop plugin as a starting point for your own project, please follow the steps outlined below:

#### Step 1
Create a new Reaction project for your new shop: https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/installation

#### Step 2
Clone this shop repository into the custom plugin folder. In your project directory, execute the following bash
 commands (Windows commands will look a bit different):
```
 $ cd <your-new-shop-directory-name>/imports/plugins/custom
 $ git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-swag-shop.git <your-new-shop-directory-name>
```

#### Step 3
Copy private asset files into your root application's /private folder
```
$ cp -Rv <your-new-shop-directory-name>/imports/plugins/custom/<your-new-shop-directory-name>/private/* <your-new-shop-directory-name>/private/plugins/<your-new-shop-directory-name>/
```

#### Step 4
Copy public files into your root application's /public folder
```
$ cp -Rv <your-new-shop-directory-name>/imports/plugins/custom/<your-new-shop-directory-name>/public/* <your-new-shop-directory-name>/public/plugins/<your-new-shop-directory-name>/
```

#### Step 5
Start Reaction
```
$ export SKIP_FIXTURES=1 && reaction run
```
